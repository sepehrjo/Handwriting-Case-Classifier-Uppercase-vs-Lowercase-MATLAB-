Cleanup Log - 20251226113816

The repository was found to be very clean with no redundant files like .DS_Store or build artifacts.
The main action taken was to flatten the directory structure by moving the core MATLAB files and image folders from the 'Handwriting Case Classifier' subfolder to the root directory.
A .gitignore file was added to prevent future clutter from MATLAB temporary files.
The README.md was rewritten to provide clear instructions on how to run the classifier.

Summary of changes:
- Moved LowercaseUppercase.m to root.
- Moved lowercase/ folder to root.
- Moved uppercase/ folder to root.
- Removed empty 'Handwriting Case Classifier' folder.
- Added .gitignore.
- Updated README.md.
